excerpt: |
  Supervised and unsupervised learning are two branches of machine learning. 
  But these terms designate much more than a mere technical distinction. 
  This post explains that unsupervised learning promises a new way to think about 
  intelligence in general: Human and otherwise.

While the mechanical phonograph cylinder was invented in 1877, it took almost an
entire century before Edison's device was released from [His Master's
Voice](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/04/28/his-masters-voice-the-origins-of-the-famous-jack-russell-terrier-nipper-the-canine-advertising-icon-for-many-gramophone-companies/).
Sound Engineers and musicians were so endeared with the [pipe
dream](https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1947.593) of [High
Fidelity](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/high-fidelity-high-definition1.htm),
that they completely overlooked the creative possibilities that the grammophone
also offered. 

Once Pandorra was out off the box &mdash; and no, it weren't [John, Paul, George
&
Ringo](https://www.unifiedmanufacturing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1.jpg)
that released her &mdash; music would never be the same again. Sound engineers
projected the recording arts beyond the spatial and temporal boundaries of
reality. Or, to put it in the lingo of Sun Ra, Music was no longer earth-bound;
space became the place.

It is high time to free the
[discourse](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generating-word-cloud-python/) of
Artificial Intelligence from its shackles of fidelity too. Technically, the
field has been ready to do so for quite a while. Unsupervised Machine Learning
is the branch of machine learning that does not need a human baseline to improve
its findings, but rather recognizes patterns that are beyond the scope of human
cognition and categorization. 

Stubborn creatures as they are, however, humans are often reluctant to
accept that their intelligence is surpassed by their own creation. Instead,
they rather hold on to their primitive and biased opinions and observations.
This post argues that this should change.

Supervised learning is the most commonly used branch of machine learning. The
supervision in its name, designates the practice of developing a human
baseline. This baseline is operationalized in the
[feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_feedback) loop between the
training data and loss function. For those not familiar with this process and
these terms, I'll briefly explain it.

Like most unborns, a machine learning model knows nothing about the world at
its inception. To improve, it needs to be taught right from wrong, or at
least better from worse. And who better to teach her than it's [creator](https://youtu.be/YqvCptqhHfs)? Right? 

In order to train a model, programmers feed a model a set of problems with known
answers ([labels](https://youtu.be/3nzvgNpeq2Q)). These anwers, however, are hidden to the model. At the end of
each learning cycle ([epoch](https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-closing-curtain-is-not-the-end-of-an-era-11584025672)) the anwers that the algorithm comes up with are
compared to the actual answers, and the difference in accuracy (or a similar
metric) is measured.

The established baseline is the alpha and omega of supervised learning. The 
computer will never come up with answers that it has not been taught. But what 
happens if we were to take the human baseline out of the [loop](https://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html)?  This process 
is called: [unsupervised learning](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/unsupervised-learning.html). In the remainder, I'll only focus clustering &mdash; a specific application of unsupervised learning &mdash; but the underlying principles hold for other techniques too.

Unsupervised learning is
[amoral](https://librivox.org/search?title=Beyond+Good+and+Evil&author=Nietzsche&reader=&keywords=&genre_id=0&status=all&project_type=either&recorded_language=&sort_order=catalog_date&search_page=1&search_form=advanced): there is no right and wrong. In fact, there is not even a clearly defined set of
problems or questions; just data points. These data points are
converted to [vectors](https://image420.com/what-is-vector-art/), which for the course of this explanation, are best thought of as
[coordinates](https://youtu.be/mgx0kT5UbKk). A unsupervised learning algorithm simply measures the distance between the
coordinates before it groups them in clusters on the basis of their [proximity](https://www.sciencealert.com/who-is-no-longer-using-the-phrase-social-distancing) to each
other.

The classic use-case for this form of unsupervised learning is in marketing.
Where marketeers used to work with [user personae](https://buffer.com/library/marketing-personas-beginners-guide), imaginary models of
how their different customers look like and behave. Machine learning turned this process upside down. Instead of defining the [models](http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/autofiction2/hoogstad.html) upfront, it discovers 
clusters of customers that are present in the data. While this was bad news 
for the story tellers amongst the marketeers, this cluster based targeting 
turned out to be much more effective&hellip; although occasional [happy 
accidents](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/) do occur, of course.

In marketing, the benefits of unsupervised learnings are easy to sell. Simply
because the human baseline is of less importance than another measurable goal:
the [bottom line](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/sports/tennis/29agassi.html). In other domains, we are often less inclined to believe that
computers can come up with better conclusions than us. 

Just imagine the following:

+ The music of Johan Sebastian Bach has more similarities to that of Justin
Bieber than to that of [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVikZ8Oe_XA)

+ The most effective way to solve the [climate crisis](http://www.unescoetxea.org/ext/manual_EDS/pdf/13_riqueza_ingles.pdf) is the global redistribution of wealth

+ President Trump only [tweets](https://www.tweetbinder.com/blog/trump-twitter/) proven facts

+ The earth is in fact [flat](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8676809/flat-earthers-trip-antarctica-planet-round/)

These findings are, of course, made up &mdash; although I believe at least one 
of them  to be true. They are here to illustrate the following point: are 
we willing to accept the superiority of an algorithm when
its conclusions are [counter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290169162_Saliency_Scale_and_Information_Towards_a_Unifying_Theory) 
to our own observations, opinions or beliefs? In other words, are we capable of dropping the human baseline? Lower our voice to make room for better ones?

We should!

Machine Learning does not need to repeat and hollow out human intelligence. It
should be used to explore new and better ways to be intelligent. The only thing
it needs to unleash its full potential is our permission to [drop the baseline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscript_and_superscript).
