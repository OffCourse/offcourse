  On the internet, lacunas of trust are mostly countered by tightening
  security measures. This move hardly ever results in the intended result,
  and almost always weakens the trust relations between digital citizens.
  With Public Badges, we enable organizations and initiatives to communicate 
  why they are trustworthy to their users.

Finding examples of [failed trust
relations](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-explainer)
has never been difficult, but today it's actually quite a challenge to miss
them. Governments don't trust their citizens to stay inside, while citizens
don't believe that their governments are acting in their best interest.
Strangers are vessels for deadly viruses, and viruses are [dangerous
weapons](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/health/fearing-terrorism-us-asks-journals-to-censor-articles-on-virus.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=grady,%20fauci&st=cse)
developed by foreign governments or [Dr.
Frankensteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clones_of_Dr._Funkenstein). In
fact, the contemporary global political landscape closely resembles a [Mexican
Standoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_standoff).

Meanwhile on the internet, things are not looking very bright either. Consumers
are constantly forced to accept a [Faustian
tradeoff](https://www.scribd.com/doc/315846903/Dr-Faust-s-Internet-Dilemma):
either hand over your personal data or give up your social life. Finding a
trustworthy source of information has become next to impossible. Knowledge is
considered an entertaining conversation starter, but does not hold any weight as
such. One man's facts is another's [fake
news](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/jared-kushner-coronavirus-fake-news).

Amidst all these suspicious minds, however, I am optimistic that we can [rebuild
trust
relations](https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/beyonce-and-jay-z-everything-is-love-guide.html)
in the public realm: both online and offline. [Public
Badges](https://github.com/OffCourse/public-badges) are a modest attempt to
provide building blocks that enable organizations and initiatives to
communicate their values with their users. To build trust relations build on
evidence, not just anecdotes.


## The Paradox of Security

> Why can't you see

> When you don't believe a word I say?

> &mdash; Elvis Presley

As my teacher Friedrich Kittler posed,
[Code](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262062749.001.0001/upso-9780262062749-chapter-6)
was originally developed to establish secure communication against a backdrop of
suspicion. Its invention dates back to the Roman Empire. Foot soldiers were
ordered to carry encrypted messages &mdash; that they could not decypher
themselves &mdash; between higher officers that were entrusted with secret
key. They thereby actively performed the paradox that holds the internet hostage
today: a secure network of communication comes at the expense of trust.

Looking back at the [history of the
internet](https://immerse.news/25-years-of-internet-its-broken-but-we-can-fix-it-24d46ccfc475),
it is easy to see that we invested a lot in making our technology secure, but
not nearly as much in making it trustworthy. Security measures alone, however,
never made our digital spaces any less dangerous. Most attempts to create safe
digital public spaces based on security alone failed or even backfired. At the
same time, the actual solution was often found by looking in exactly the
opposite direction: building [networks of
trust](https://cheerleading.lovetoknow.com/Cheerleading_Pyramids).

In order to illustrate this, I'll walk you through a relatively recent example:
the [history of spam
filtering](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/a-brief-history-of-spam-filtering-and-deliverability-gunter-haselberger/).
Up until the mid 1990's, little to nothing was done to prevent the unwanted
soliciting on the internet. However, the rising importance of digital
communication combined with the overwhelming increase of unwanted emails created
a demand for spam filters. The first attempts all revolved around blocking
suspicious domain and filtering for unwanted emails. These measure, however,
weren't very effective. Spammers soon discovered techniques like domain and
identity spoofing that made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between
email and
[spam](https://www.frolichawaii.com/stories/okinawas-potama-spam-musubi-sandwiches-are-coming-waikiki).

The big breakthrough came during the mid 2000's when ISP's shifted to so-called
reputation lists, something that was complemented with engagement metrics over
the last decade. Instead of just building blacklists, ISP's started sharing
their whitelist and other positive metrics with another. Turns out, it's much
more effective to build networks of trusted partners than to police the
offenders. (The history of anti-virus software by the way is remarkably
similar.)


## Invest in Trust

> And we can't build our dreams    
> On suspicious minds

In order to make the internet more safe, we have to invest in building networks
of trust. In order to achieve this, technology alone can never be the answer. As
the history of spam filtering shows, coalitions of actual people and
organizations are an excellent medicine against the side-effects of algorithms.
But technology can be part of the solution. And technology needs to be. Because
even more dangerous than letting trust be a purely algorithmic consideration, is
leaving it entirely anecdotal. ["I know him, he's a good
guy"](https://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/989101/10-ways-to-tell-if-he-is-a-good-guy/),
is a statement that was invalidated for once and for all by: ["Don't be
evil."](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393)

The safety of our [Public Spaces](https://publicspaces.net) needs to be evidence
based. With [Public Badges](https://github.com/OffCourse/public-badges), we
enable organizations to collect and communicate the evidence around the values
that they consider valuable. In future posts, I'll write more about the exact
mechanisms that we are developing to facilitate these processes. For now,
however, I want to conclude by saying this:
sustainable safety cannot be built upon security. Let's invest in trust instead.
