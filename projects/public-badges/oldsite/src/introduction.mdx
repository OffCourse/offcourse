# Zero Badge

The Zero Badge is a way for organizations that are part of the Public
Spaces coalition to show their affiliation on their website. It provides
visible evidence to the user that the organization has the intention to
implement the Public Spaces values in their online presence.

## Get Involved

### 1. Make sure that your organization meets the criteria for Zero Badge
During this phase of development, it is only possible for the founding
partners of Public Spaces to apply for the Zero Badge.

In a later phase, we will open this project up to other organizations.

If you're organization that is interested in joining the Public Spaces coalition,
please contact us: [contact@public-spaces.org](contact@public-spaces.org).


### 2. Embed the Public Spaces Badges Container into your webpage

[todo]: Decide on the name. 'Public Spaces Badges Container' is not exactly
catchy...

In order to acquire the zero badge, you have to include the Public Spaces Badge
Container webcomponent on your organization's website.

You can download it from npm:

```bash
npm install @public-badges/container
yarn add @public-badges/container
```

```js
import PublicBadgesContainer from "@public-badges/container"
```

or host it directly:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@public-badges/container@1.0.0/umd/container.production.min.js" async></script>
```

The Public Spaces Badges Container is a [webcomponent](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)
that you can use directly in your html.

```html
<PublicBadgesContainer />
```

Documentation for the use of webcomponents with your frontend framework of choice,
can be found here: [https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview).


### 3. Apply for the Zero Badge
