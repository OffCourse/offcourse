title: testable value profile
as a: |
  CEO of a value-driven online company 
I want: |
  the online activities of all my teams to be automatically 
  tested against a value profile that consist of both our 
  commercial targets and ethical values, vice versa this value
  profile periodically get evaluated and recalibrated based 
  on the de facto activities of my team 
so that: |
  all teams work from an undisputed, aligned set of values, 
  productivity is thereby by 150% without endangering the ethical 
  values of my company
